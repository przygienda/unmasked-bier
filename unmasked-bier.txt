                   draft-zzhang-bier-unmasked-bier-01

Abstract

   The document introduces a new mode of interpretation of the bitmask
   field in the BIER encoding, called unmasked BIER, that solves the
   problem of BIER originator targeting receivers across many different
   sets and hence, in worst case, degrading into ingress replication.

1.  Introduction

   BIER technology [RFC8296] in its standard form may suffer from a
   degradation towards ingress replication in a scenario where the total
   number of involved BFRs is very large but most packets address
   varying combination of relatively few receivers spread across
   different sets.

   More explicitly, BIER carries in its standard form a bitmask of
   successive BFR receivers represented as bits in a set and thus on
   large numbers of involved BFRs and few receivers w/o customized
   allocation of BFR IDs or application awareness of the address
   locality each receiver on a packet may be found in a different set in
   most extreme cases.  Obviously, when receivers are in different sets,
   multiple packets must be sent, one per involved set.  Such a scenario
   can become common in large distributed computation environments based
   on consensus building algorithms (or building closures by successive
   folding of results), e.g. multi-CPU HPC or data centers and RAID
   storage where storing data while addressing large number of always
   changing stripes can lead to this kind of anomaly.

2.  Unmasked BIER

   To deal with the problem of small number of receivers spread across
   many sets we introduce into BIER a special interpretation of the
   bitmask field called unmasked BIER or U-BIER for brevity's sake.
   U-BIER bitmask is interpreted as sequence of BFR-IDs that can belong
   to different sets and be interspersed with "holes" consisting of
   illegal BFR-IDs to increase hardware processing efficiency.

   Support for processing of unmasked BIER is indicated by signalling
   special label or its equivalent analogous to BIER Encapsulation
   signalling.  Based on this info the upstream node can decide on a
   hop-by-hop basis whether it compresses the same BIER frames it
   received for different sets (how the recognition of same frames is
   performed is outside the scope of this document) into a single U-BIER
   frame or propagates a U-BIER frame with according changes, i.e. only
   providing the BFR-IDs for which the receiver is responsible.  The
   removal of BFR IDs from the packet before forwarding it is completely
   analogous to the normal bitmask processing in a sense but here
   spanning possibly many sets in the lookup engine.  In case the
   downstream receiver does not support U-BIER the frame needs to be
   replicated into according standard BIER frames with usual bitmask
   interpretation.

3.  U-BIER Interpretation of the bitmask field

   The bitmask field MUST be interpreted in U-BIER mode as sequence of
   BFR-IDs (as an example, within 256 bits maximum 16 receivers can be
   encoded) whereas illegal BFR-IDs are allowed in any position and MUST
   be ignored.  Duplicates are also allowed and MUST be treated as a
   single occurrence.  No guarantees are provided in terms of sorting of
   the BFR-IDs in U-BIER.

4.  Signalling for MPLS in ISIS via U-Mode BIER MPLS Encapsulation Sub-
    sub-TLV

   The signalling follows the BIER MPLS Encapsulation Sub-sub-TLV, i.e.
   it is <MT,SD,BML> specific but obviously does not include the concept
   of a set.

      Type: TBD1

      Length: 4 * of U-Mode BitString Length specific labels.

      Reserved: MUST be 0 on send and ignored on reception.

      Label: Frames received on this label interpret the BitMask as
      U-BIER.

   In case multiple values are advertised for same bitstring length, the
   sub-sub-TLV MUST be ignored.  In case same label value is advertised
   for different bitstring lengths, the sub-sub-TLV MUST be ignored.

   Label values MUST NOT match any of the reserved values defined in
   [RFC3032].

5.  Further Considerations

   U-BIER can be deployed within existing BIER node by node, either as
   addition or the only mode supported.  Observe that in an environment
   where only some nodes support U-BIER those may have to disaggregate
   U-BIER into normal BIER and hence fall back to average replication.
   In a network where some nodes support only U-BIER normal BIER nodes
   may consider them not supporting BIER at all or may perform
   translation from normal BIER into U-BIER frames, however, it must be
   expected that they will use a single frame and basically send U-BIER
   with the BFR IDs of a single set only, not rendering any gains unless
   a mechanism is in place the same frame is detected sent on multiple
   sets and coalesced into a single U-BIER frame.  This can be achieved
   by many mechanisms out the scope of this draft, amongst them a shim
   after the BIER encapsulation [I-D.zzhang-bier-extension-headers] in
   way similar to inband telemetry or fragmentation support.

   Mixing U-BIER and normal BIER within a subdomain can lead to
   difficulties of decoding the according packets in the middle in terms
   of destinations targeted if the involved parties in the middle do not
   possess the correct binding information.  An obvious method to deal
   with this problem is to deploy U-BIER specifically in its own sub-
   domain where the interpretation of the bitmask is unambiguous.
