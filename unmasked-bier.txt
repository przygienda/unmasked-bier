1.  Introduction

2.  Signalling

   The only signalling necessary is a Sub-TLV of the IS-IS Router
   Capability TLV-242 that is defined in [RFC7981] with the following
   format.  The Sub-TLV MUST be advertised by a node that is actively
   running any prunner except zero-prunner and the absence of this Sub-
   TLV signifies a node being a 'zero-prunner'.

      Algorithm: a numeric identifier in the range 0 .. 2^16-1 that
      identifies the algorithm used to calculate CDS (flooding topology)
      of the component from the IGP Flooding Prunner Registry as
      assigned per Section 4.

3.  Security Considerations


4.  IANA Section

   IANA is requested to set up a registry called "IGP Flooding Prunner
   Type" under the existing "Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) Parameters"
   IANA registry.

   Values in this registry come from the range 0 .. 2^16-1.

   The following values are defined:

      0-255: Reserved with values aligned with algorithm numbers in
      _draft-dynamic-flooding_.

      256: MANET Based Algorithm described in this document.

      257 .. 32767: Standardized distributed algorithms assigned in the
      registry.

      32767 ..  65534: Private algorithms.  Individual values are to be
      assigned according to the "Private Use" policy defined in
      [RFC8126].

      65535: Reserved
